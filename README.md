**Pockt** is an ultra-minimal, SwiftUI-based expense tracker that lets you log earnings and spendings in a single tap. Designed for speed and simplicity, Pockt uses Core Data for local storage and offers a clean, intuitive interface that keeps you focused on your money, not menus.

It is now on App Store: https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/pockt/id6745688416

## Features

* **One-Tap Entry**: Quickly log any earning or expense by entering amount, selecting a category icon, and an optional note.
* **Category Icons**: Built-in SF Symbol icon set for categories; add custom categories with icons and colors.
* **Multi-Currency Support**: Switch between TRY, USD, EUR, and GBP in Settings; amounts update across the app using `@AppStorage`.
* **Filters**: Instantly filter transactions by Today, This Month, This Year, or All Time.
* **Detail View**: Tap an entry to view, edit, or delete; see exact timestamp, note, and category.
* **Minimal UI**: Clean SwiftUI design, lightweight, distraction-free experience.

* Xcode 15+
